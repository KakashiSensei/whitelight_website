                            account), White Light may collect personally-identifying information that is unique to such users
                            (such as their name, profile picture, gender, internet protocol (IP) address and Facebook friend

                                    2. Other information We also receive and/or collect other types of data and information about users via our services, as
                            follows: <br />• We regularly receive non-personally-identifying information
                            about you or about the device you use to enhance our services, such as your browser type, language
                            preference referring site and any other information automatically sent to White Light by the
                            user's browser. <br />• We receive data about you whenever you use or interact with White Light,
                            such as how and when you view, use or otherwise interact with content and materials in our WebSite.
                            For example, we may infer data from your replies and answers to the quizzes in this WebSite or
                            the results thereof, as further delineated below. <br />• When you post or create content on White
                            Light, such as feedbacks, quizzes or other games, we may receive additional related data (or
                            metadata), such as the time, date, and place you posted or created such content. <br />• Sometimes
                            we get data from our partners, publishers, commercial customers and other third parties that
                            helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand our users' online activities, provide with insight
                            into what our users are interested in, maximize the effectiveness of ads, and generally make
                            our services better.
                        </p>

                                    We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others (including those described
                            hereunder), but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for longer periods. However,
                            you acknowledge and agree that We may continue to use any non-personally-identifying information
                            in accordance with this Privacy Policy (e.g., for the purpose of analysis, statistics and the
                            like) also after the termination of your membership to this website and\or use of our services,
                            for any reason whatsoever.

                            <div>
                                We use the information and data we collect in connection with operation, maintenance and enhancement of our services and
                        features, and for other administrative purposes or internal operations, such as communicating with
                        our users, data analysis, testing and research. In addition, We may use the information and data
                        we collect about you in order to measure and understand the effectiveness of our ads and other content
                        and offer you tailored content, like giving you more relevant ads. For example, your birthday, gender
                        and other demographic characteristics allow us to show you age-appropriate and gender-related content
                        and advertisements. We may also examine and analyze your feedback and answers to the quizzes in our
                        WebSite to serve ads that you may enjoy or find interesting. For example, if a user participates
                        in content around new model cars, We may infer that this user is planning to purchase a new vehicle
                        or that he/she recently purchased a new vehicle. Alternatively, if a user indicates in a quiz that
                        he/she enjoys baseball, We may infer this user is a sport fan. Advertisers of either automotive or
                        sports products may ask us to display advertisements to individuals that have an affinity towards
                        their products. White Light processes Personal Information on its servers in many countries around
                        the world. Such information may be stored on any of our servers, at any location.

                                <p>Except as described hereunder, We do not share your Personal Information with third parties unless
                            We have received your permission to do so, or given you notice thereof (such as by telling you
                            about it in this Privacy Policy), or removed your name and any other personally identifying information
                            from it. For example, We may inform our advertisers and publishers how their ads perform or how
                            many users viewed or clicked on their ads. We will ask for your consent before using information
                            for a purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.

                        post contents and materials in, and create quizzes and other games through, the Website, as further
                        delineated in our EULA. Any contents, materials and games which you have publicly posted or published
                        on the WebSite or otherwise through our services shall be publicly available by default, and you
                        may appear in the WebSite as the creator thereof. In addition, the username, the full name and the

                                    2. Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement<br />White Light may identify a user to third parties
                            and/or share your information (including your Personal Information) if required to do so by law,
                            or in the good-faith belief that disclosing such information is necessary to comply with any
                            law, regulation or other governmental authority, or respond to any court order, subpoena, search
                            warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief an action is needed in order to protect
                            the safety or security of any personal or property. White Light also reserves the right to disclose
                            any information in case it believes, in good faith, that such disclosure is appropriate or necessary
                            in order to enforce our EULA, take precautions against liabilities, investigate and defend itself
                            against any third party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, protect
                            the security or integrity of the WebSite and our servers and protect the rights and property,
                            of White Light, its users and\or others.

                                    3. Non-Personal Aggregate Information<br /> White Light may publish or share with third parties
                            aggregate information for the purpose of analysis and statistics. Such disclosure is done anonymously
                            and is non-personally identifiable. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends
                            about the general use of our services.

                            web browser is set to permit storage of cookies). We may use such cookies to help us learn about
                            how you use this WebSite, user demographics and enhance your online experience. Users can install

                                    5. Reorganization or Insolvency<br /> White Light may also transfer Personal Information to a
                            successor entity upon a merger, consolidation, change of control or other corporate reorganization
                            in which White Light participates, or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of White Light's
                            shares or assets to which the WebSite relates. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or equivalents,
                            White Light may not be able to control how your Personal Information is handled, shared or used.
                            However, in all such events, We will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such third
                            parties from disclosing your Personal Information.

                        your system to our servers and in securing such Personal Information stored on our systems. However,
